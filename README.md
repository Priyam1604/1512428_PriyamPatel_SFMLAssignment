A C# program that uses SFML to connect the balls that moves randomly with a line.


Strength of Linked List:


The linked list is a dynamic data structure.
We can also decrease and increase the linked list at run-time. That is, you can allocate and deallocate memory at run-time itself.
The access time is very fast, and it can be accessed at a certain time without memory overhead.
In this, you can easily do insertion and deletion functions. 
That is, you can easily insert and delete the node.


Weakness of  Linked List are:


The linked list requires more memory to store the elements than an array, because each node of the linked list points a pointer, due to which it requires more memory.
It is very difficult to traverse the nodes in a linked list. In this, we cannot access randomly to any one node. (As we do in the array by index.) For example: â€“ If we want to traverse a node in an n position, then we have to traverse all the nodes that come before n, which will spoil a lot of our time.
Reverse traversing in a linked list is very difficult, because it requires more memory for the pointer.
Random access is not possible in a linked list due to its dynamic memory allocation.



Issues encountered while design and implementation of Linked List:


Mouse Press and Key Press not working during adding or removing the node and the escape button didn't work.

Faced issues with drawing the circles.

Had problems while labeling the circles with the values.
Had issues with the rotation of the  balls.




Real World Application of the Linked List are:


It is used to implement stacks and queues which are like fundamental needs throughout computer science.
To prevent the collision between the data in the hash map, we use a singly linked list.
If we ever noticed the functioning of a casual notepad, it also uses a singly linked list to perform undo or redo or deleting functions.
We can think of its use in a photo viewer for having look at photos continuously in a slide show.




Worst time and space complexity of Linked List are:


Data Structure:	Access	Search	Insertion	Deletion

Singly Linked
 List			0(N)		0(N)		0(1)		0(1)

Doubly Linked 
List			0(N)		0(N)		0(1)		0(1)
